    <h1>My First Valid HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This page contains all the minimum required elements for HTML5 validation.</p>
    <!-- Heading Level 1 (The main title of the page) -->
    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio Website</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>
        This page serves as the entry point to my web development journey. It demonstrates the fundamental structure of a valid HTML5 document, including the essential DOCTYPE, head, and body elements. Learning these basics is the critical first step toward building complex, responsive web applications.

    <!-- Heading Level 2 (A major section heading) -->
    <h2>The Importance of Semantic HTML</h2>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <p>
        Using semantic tags like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is crucial not only for structure but also for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). These tags give meaning to the content, allowing browsers and assistive technologies to interpret the page correctly.
    </p>

    <!-- Third Paragraph -->
    <p>
        For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag clearly marks the primary title of the page, ensuring that users and search engines know what the page is about. Similarly, paragraphs organize blocks of text logically, enhancing readability for all users and improving document flow.
    </p>

    <!-- Heading Level 3 (A sub-section heading) -->
    <h3>My Educational Journey</h3>

    <!-- Fourth Paragraph -->
    <p>
        My studies are focused on full-stack web development, covering everything from front-end design to back-end logic and database management. I am committed to following best practices, including always validating my HTML code with the official HTML Validator to catch structural errors early. This ensures my code is robust and compliant with web standards.
